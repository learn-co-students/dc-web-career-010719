## Goal: Trick React into thinking a change in store is a change in props
We want to "inject" the store as a prop to all of our components

## Problems we still have
- store.subscribe(() => this.forceUpdate())
  - Re-rendering components automatically
    - Decide which state each component needs

- Everything in one file! How do we organize our code?
- Referencing store/state in different files


## Redux dev tools
- [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en)


### React-redux
- [Documentation](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md)
js```npm install --save react-redux```


### Provider
- appears once
- wrap our app in a <Provider> component
- takes in store prop


### connect
- Dependent on Provider component
- Used to connect the state inside store to the props inside a Component
- Use Case:
  - Header components needs state.count js```store.getState().count```
  - It'd be nice if we could pass that data was props to Header component
  - js```this.props.count```

- Takes in a function and returns a Higher Order Component


### Higher Order Components
- a function that takes in a component and returns a new component (usually with additional props)

js
```
const withCount = (SomeComponent) => {
  class WrappedComponent extends React.Component {
    render(){
      return <SomeComponent count={store.getState().count} {...this.props} />
    }
  }
  return WrappedComponent
}
const ConnectedHeader = withCount(Header)
```

### Using connect
- js
```
const withCount = connect((state) => {
    return {count: state.count}
})
const ConnectedHeader = withCount(Header)
```

## mapStateToProps
js```
const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
    return {count: state.count}
}
const withCount = connect(mapStateToProps)
const ConnectedHeader = withCount(Header)
```
js```
export default connect(mapStateToProps)(Header)
```
